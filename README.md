- (Secured) local data storage using [react-native-keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain#readme)
- Splash screen using [expo-splash-screen](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/)
- API requests using [axios](https://axios-http.com/)

- [Logger](https://github.com/ajaykumar97/react-native-simple-logger) to log data more clearly using coloured logs in Chrome Debugger
- [Net Info](https://github.com/react-native-netinfo/react-native-netinfo) to listen for network conditions updates.
- [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) for form state management and validation.

## Prerequisite
1. Make sure that you have followed the environment setup instructions properly from the official [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

2. Make sure that your Cocoapods version is >= 3.5.7. If its lower than 3.5.7, you can update it using the following command:

```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

3. The installation command will fail if you have the global legacy `react-native-cli` installed in your machine. Make sure you uninstall it first:

```shell
yarn global remove react-native-cli
```

or if using `npm`

```shell
npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
```

## Quick start

Generate a new React Native(**v0.74**) app using the **@ajaysidhu/react-native-template**:

```shell
npx react-native init myapp --template @ajaysidhu/react-native-template --skip-install --pm npm --skip-git-init
```

You might also be prompted to confirm the installation for the packages `react-native` and `husky`. Simply hit `enter` to proceed.

The template will automatically install the `npm` dependencies and the `pods` (if you are on the MacOS).

## Install from GitHub
If you want to use the template directly from the `GitHub` or try out the latest features which are not release to the `npm` yet, then you can run:

```shell
npx react-native init myapp --template https://github.com/ajaykumar97/react-native-template.git --skip-install --pm npm --skip-git-init
```

## Notes
1. Starting React Native **v0.74**, Xcode does not start Metro bundler automatically. If you are running the app from the XCode, please make sure that your metro bundler is running before running the build from XCode. You can start the metro bundler by running the following command in the root directory of your newly created project using this template:

```shell
npm start
```

2. Minimum supported versions:
- iOS: 15
- Android: 26

## Use Older versions

If you want to use an older version of the template, then you can run(replace `version` with your desired version):

```shell
npx react-native init myapp --template @ajaysidhu/react-native-template@version --skip-install --pm npm --skip-git-init
```

You can look at all versions, that I have published [here](https://github.com/ajaykumar97/react-native-template/tags).

## Configure Google Service Files

If you want to extend the setup further to configure Google Service files for **Development**, **Testing**, **Staging** and **Production** environments, you can follow my [this](https://medium.com/swlh/part-3-configure-bundle-ids-app-name-and-google-service-files-94aed34bbca5) Medium post.
