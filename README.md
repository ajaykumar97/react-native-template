# react-native-template

## Getting Started

Create a new project using the template.

- **Note:** the command will fail if you have the global legacy react-native-cli installed. Make sure you uninstall it first. More info at [react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli#about).

### RN 0.63.4

```bash
$ npx react-native init MyApp --template @ajaysidhu/react-native-template
