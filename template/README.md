# projectname

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`react-native-template`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ajaysidhu/react-native-template).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Quick Start](https://github.com/ajaykumar97/react-native-template?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) step without any error, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run androidDevelopmentDebug

# OR using Yarn
yarn androidDevelopmentDebug
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run iosDevelopmentDebug

# OR using Yarn
yarn iosDevelopmentDebug
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively. Checkout the [available scripts](https://github.com/ajaykumar97/react-native-template/blob/master/template/package.json#L5) to explore other environments.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `src/screens/AuthScreens/Login/index.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu**(<kbd>Ctrl ^</kbd> + <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>) in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
