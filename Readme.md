## Using the boilerplate

To create a new project using the boilerplate:

- clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ajaykumar97/react_native_project_boilerplate`
- remove the previous git history: `rm -rf .git/`
- install the npm dependencies by running `yarn`
- rename the React Native project to your own project name: `react-native-rename <newName>` (the default name is `Boilerplate`).

You can install `react-native-rename` from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rename)

You can now create a new git repository for your project (using `git init`) and create the first commit.

## Running the project

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can setup and run the project by running:

- `react-native run-android` to run the Android application (remember to start a simulator or connect an Android phone)
- `react-native run-ios` to run the iOS application (remember to start a simulator or connect an iPhone phone)
